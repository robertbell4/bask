lizard sunning game

This is my first attempt at any game development. 
Will start by making something run in the terminal, work up from there.

This will be the life of a lizard surviving through a nuclear winter.
Main goal of the game will be to compete for warmth.

Display:

The display will be made up of amap of 3x5 sized tiles. The top row, leftmost column and rightmost column will contain whitespace.
